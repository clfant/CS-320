How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  You can ensure your code is funcitonal and secure by desiging a test sequence to try and break your code. You design the tests to intentionally fail or pass certain aspects to see how your code deals with the data. If all of your tests pass then you know your code is functioning properly.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  The best way to interpret user needs is to have a conversation with them. Ask questions and get to the root of what they need/want. You then need to take those needs and develop the code from that conversation.
How do I approach designing software?
  I approach software develop methodically. I take smaller portions of it and build out from there. Typically I start with a module that is needed in every part of the code. Antoher way is to take the list of requirements and use it as a list to develop the code as you go down the list.
